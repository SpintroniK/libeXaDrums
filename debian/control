Description: Software drum module (development)
 ExaDrums is a virtual drum module that allows drummers play with
 custom-made drum kits.
 .
 It is user-friendly and combines high quality stereo sound with low
 latency.
 .
 Each drum kit provides individual sliders in order to control the
 volume of its drum pads.
 .
 A built-in metronome can be combined with a rhythm coach to make
 practice sessions easier and efficient.
 .
 The drum triggers can be adjusted so that their response feels as
 natural as possible, and different sensor interfaces include a
 virtual (on-screen) multi pad and external sensors.
 .
 Although eXaDrums is usable as a drum module, it is still an
 experimental project. As such, some features are not yet implemented,
 and the error management is not complete.
 .
 This package provides the C++ headers.
